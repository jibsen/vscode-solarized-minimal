# Solarized Minimal for VS Code

![Solarized Minimal Sample](images/solmin-vscode-sample.png)

[Solarized Minimal][solmin] is a color theme using the [Solarized][] palette
by Ethan Schoonover. One of the unique features of Solarized is that it
supports both a dark and light theme, using the same sixteen colors.

[Visual Studio Code][vscode] supports syntax highlighting based on the format
and grammar used in TextMate. This makes it possible to theme pretty much any
part of a document, but that doesn't necessarily mean you should.

Solarized Minimal attempts to create a more homogeneous and subtle use of
the Solarized palette by assigning colors primarily through the root groups
described in the [TextMate documentation][grammar].
